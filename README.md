# Gemini AI Flask Application

This is a simple Flask application that integrates with the Google Gemini AI model to generate text responses based on user input. The application provides a web interface where users can submit their input, and the AI model generates a response which is then displayed on the web page.

## Requirements

Before running the application, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- google-generativeai
- mistletoe

You can install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install Flask google-generativeai mistletoe
```

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/gemini-ai-flask-app.git
    cd gemini-ai-flask-app
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Configure API Key**:

    Open `app.py` and replace `'enter your gemini ai key here'` with your actual Gemini AI API key.

    ```python
    API_KEY = 'your_actual_gemini_ai_key'
    ```

## Running the Application

To start the Flask application, navigate to the project directory and run:

```bash
python app.py
```

The application will start on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`. Open this URL in your web browser to access the web interface.

## Usage

- **Main Page**: The main page provides a text input field where you can enter your prompt.
- **Generate Response**: After entering your input, submit the form, and the AI model will generate a response that will be displayed on the page.

## Files

- `app.py`: The main Flask application code.
- `templates/index.html`: The HTML template for the web interface.

## Error Handling

If the application fails to generate a response, an error message will be logged, and a JSON response with the error will be returned.
